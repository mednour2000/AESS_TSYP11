# MembaTronix - Iced Seas Exploration Robot

MembaTronix is a serpent-shaped robot designed for exploring icy moons like Enceladus. This README provides essential information about the project, its components, and the robot's capabilities.

## Project Structure

In this repository, you'll find several folders representing different parts of the robot:

- `Anchor`
- `Damper`
- `Camera`
- `Chain`
- `Galet`

Additionally, there is an `Other Parts` folder containing components such as `Vise Archimede`, `Helice`, `Queue`, `Head`, and `Sapphire Glass`. Each folder contains SolidWorks conception files for the respective part.

You can also find a STEP file named `robot_tass.STEP` that contains the assembly of the entire robot.

## Robot Description

The MembaTronix snake robot is an innovative solution tailored for the exploration of icy moons like Enceladus. It features:

- Length: 4000mm
- Diameter: 500mm
- Mass: 100kg

### Head of the Snake Robot

The head comprises:

- Archimedean screw-shaped helix
- Thermal camera
- Sapphire glass lens

Material: Aluminium for thermal camera and sapphire glass lens.

#### Modular Structure

The robot's modular structure allows seamless movement in both horizontal and vertical directions, adapting effortlessly to the challenging topography of Enceladus.

### Segments

The Archimedean screw-like structure of the segments enables the robot to move by rotating its segments in opposite directions. Each segment is 1000mm long, made of aluminium, with titanium joints providing flexibility for slithering or undulating motion.

### MembaTronix Trail

#### Anchor

The anchor secures the robot in place during operations or observations.

## Challenges Addressed

- **Exceptional Adaptability:** Interconnected segments and rotating propulsion units facilitate seamless movement across diverse terrains and varying crevice sizes.
- **Vertical & Horizontal Mobility:** Effortless navigation in both directions enables comprehensive exploration of Enceladus' challenging topography.
- **Resilience to Extreme Conditions:** Specialized design and materials ensure functionality in low temperatures, high pressures, and across icy surfaces.
- **Thermographic Precision:** Integration of a sapphire glass lens enhances durability and optical clarity in capturing critical thermal and visual data.

## Mission Capabilities

- **Drilling Capabilities:** Ability to drill into Enceladus' surface or subsurface for sample collection and analysis.
- **Mobility:** Efficient movement across diverse terrains, including vertical and horizontal navigation.
- **Subsurface Exploration:** Ability to navigate and swim within the subsurface ocean for potential analysis of its properties.
- **Communication Systems:** Capable of effective communication with the surface module or orbiting spacecraft, ensuring data transmission and mission coordination.

## Adaptability and Versatility

The MembaTronix robot excels in adaptability and versatility, making it a powerful tool for exploring the unique and challenging environments of icy moons like Enceladus.
